Oh my food

Hello, 
I hope you are well, this is a website created using html, CSS & sass (this website has no JavaScript). It is a fully responsive to any screen size, it is a website designed to allow you to order food for a restaurant called Ohmyfood. It has 5 pages including the home page, if you click on each card it will take you to the page for that card. The website includes animations and a loader when you first open the website. The animations are on the menu pages, they are not the main home page. Whenever you hover on a menu, the animations will appear on the right-hand side (this is for the desktop version). On the mobile and tablet version you would have to touch the menu for the animations to appear. 
Thank you very much for taking the time to view my website.
Kind Regards 
Yusuf
