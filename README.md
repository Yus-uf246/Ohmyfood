Oh my food

Hello, 

I hope you are well, this is a website created using html, css & sass (this website has no JavaScript). It is a fully responsive to any screen size, it is a website designed to allow you to order food for a restaurent called Ohmyfood. It has 5 pages including the home page, if you click on the each card it will take you to the page for that card. The website includes animations and a loader when you first open the website. I have designed it so that when on the website version.
